This project was a coding activity for a potential employer. It is an appointment keeper application that shows 1 hour time slot buttons from 9AM until 5PM. When the user clicks on a button, a modal appears with a form asking for information on whoever is taking that appointment time slot. The form asks for name and phone number. Then the user has the option to submit the information, clear the information or close the modal. If the user has entered and submitted the data, the modal will close and the button for the taken time slot will turn red. This application was made with REACT.js, and Bootstrap using the flux architecture. It does not use any database, it saves all information to local storage.
